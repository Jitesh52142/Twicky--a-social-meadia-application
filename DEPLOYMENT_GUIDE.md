# 🚀 Twicky Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ Vercel Issue Summary

Your app keeps failing on Vercel with "500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" because:
1. **Environment variables are NOT set** (most likely cause)
2. Vercel's serverless architecture has limitations for Django
3. Image uploads won't persist on Vercel

---

## 🎯 Recommended: Deploy to Railway

Railway is **perfect** for Django apps. It's literally 3 commands:

### Quick Deploy to Railway:

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login (opens browser)
railway login

# 3. Deploy!
railway init
railway up
```

### Set Environment Variables in Railway:

After deployment, go to Railway dashboard and add:
```
SECRET_KEY=n=0x-e0du-eq8q9f4*6vz-rhl9p3lr7(^kviw85t)utg964a60
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.railway.app
```

**Done!** Your app will be live with full functionality! 🎉

## 🔧 Alternative: Fix Vercel

If you still want to use Vercel, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these 4 variables (check Production, Preview, Development for each):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | `n=0x-e0du-eq8q9f4*6vz-rhl9p3lr7(^kviw85t)utg964a60` |
| `DEBUG` | `False` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `.vercel.app` |
| `VERCEL` | `1` |

### Step 2: Redeploy

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "..." on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### ⚠️ Vercel Limitations:
- ❌ Images won't persist (serverless)
- ❌ Need external database
- ❌ Complex setup

## 🎯 My Strong Recommendation

**Use Railway!** Here's why:

1. **It just works** - No environment variable headaches
2. **Full functionality** - Images work perfectly
3. **Free database** - PostgreSQL included
4. **3 commands** - Literally: `npm i -g @railway/cli && railway login && railway up`
5. **Django-friendly** - Designed for frameworks like Django

Vercel is great for static sites, but Django + image uploads + database needs traditional hosting like Railway.
