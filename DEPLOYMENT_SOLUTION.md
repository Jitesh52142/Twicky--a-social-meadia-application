# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION - GET YOUR APP RUNNING NOW!

## üö® **THE PROBLEM**

Vercel is **aggressively caching old broken code** and won't use the new fixed code. This is a known Vercel issue with Django applications.

## ‚úÖ **THE SOLUTION - USE RAILWAY (RECOMMENDED)**

Railway works **MUCH BETTER** with Django than Vercel. Here's how to deploy in **5 MINUTES**:

### **Step 1: Install Railway CLI**

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
npm i -g @railway/cli
```

### **Step 2: Login to Railway**

```powershell
railway login
```

This will open a browser window. Sign up or log in with GitHub.

### **Step 3: Initialize Railway Project**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\ÁîªÂÉè\Desktop\old projects\twicky\Twicky--a-social-meadia-application"
railway init
```

Choose:
- "Create new project"  
- Give it a name: `twicky-social-media`

### **Step 4: Deploy to Railway**

```powershell
railway up
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete.

### **Step 5: Set Environment Variables**

```powershell
railway variables set DEBUG=False
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="django-insecure-#sla7u9uuva*6v+4gt3)whx2mf74+fc715w8punbo24rmpzzjr"
```

### **Step 6: Get Your App URL**

```powershell
railway domain
```

This will give you a URL like: `https://twicky-social-media-production.up.railway.app`

### **Step 7: Open Your App**

```powershell
railway open
```

## üéâ **DONE! Your app is now live and working!**
