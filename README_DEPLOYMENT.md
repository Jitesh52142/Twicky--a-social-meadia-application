### **Option 3: Vercel (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

⚠️ **Warning**: Vercel has severe caching issues with Django. Multiple deploy attempts failed due to Vercel not picking up code changes.

**If you still want to try:**
1. Delete existing Vercel project
2. Run `npx vercel --prod`
3. Set environment variables in dashboard
4. Cross your fingers 🤞

📖 **Guide**: Read `DEPLOYMENT_SOLUTION.md`
